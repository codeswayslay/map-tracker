# Map Tracker
A map tracker simulation I wrote for an interview. The application simulates tracking moving vehicles across a map, and also showing traffic hotspots. Application uses Leaflet mapping library.

## Task 1
Simulation of vehicle tracking on the map.

## Task 2
Simulation of traffic hotspots, changing colour at random. The colours represent traffic severity.

## Task 3
Simulation of vehicle tracking and traffic hotspots. Basically, a combination of **Task 1** and **Task 2**.

### Note
You will need to deploy the Java [back-end](https://github.com/teamlead-agbaje/map-tracker-server) for this application in order to for it to run properly. The back-end takes care of providing this front-end with the latitude-longitude coordinates it needs to simulate vehicle position on the map.
